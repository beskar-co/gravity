# Gravity

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@beskar-labs%2Fgravity.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/@beskar-labs%2Fgravity)

Gravity is a design system to power experiences from [Beskar Labs](https://www.beskar.co/). Components are primarily built on [Radix UI primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/) with styling mostly derived from [@shadcn's UI project](https://ui.shadcn.com/). The components have been precomposed for rapid development and consistent interfaces.

The goal of Gravity is to provide a consistent set of opinionated components that can be implemented quickly and predictably across various projects made by Beskar Labs, however you're welcome to use it in your own projects.

## Installation

Install the package with your package manager of choice.

```sh
yarn add @beskar-labs/gravity
```

Add the relevant providers and components to your application:

```tsx
import { TooltipProvider } from '@beskar-labs/gravity/tooltip';
import { Toaster } from '@beskar-labs/gravity/toast';
import type { ReactNode } from 'react';

const RootLayout: FC<{
  children: ReactNode;
}> = () => (
  <>
    <TooltipProvider>{children}</TooltipProvider>
    <Toaster />
  </>
);

export default RootLayout;
```

Use the components in your application:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@beskar-labs/gravity/button';

const MyComponent: FC = () => (
  <Button onClick={() => alert('Hello world!')}>Click me!</Button>
);
```
